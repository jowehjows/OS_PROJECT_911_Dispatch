# 🚨 911 OS Dispatch Simulator
A comprehensive, interactive Operating Systems simulator themed around a 911 Emergency Dispatch Center. This desktop application was developed as a final project for BS Computer Engineering to demonstrate the practical, real-world application of core OS resource management algorithms.

Instead of abstract numbers, this system maps traditional OS concepts to physical dispatch logistics:

Processes 
→
 Incoming 911 Emergencies
CPU 
→
 Emergency Response Units
RAM 
→
 Dispatcher Radio/Video Bandwidth
Virtual Pages 
→
 Active Dispatcher Dashboard Monitors
Disk Head 
→
 Drone/Patrol Car Routing
⚙️ Core OS Implementations
The dashboard features five dynamic modules:

CPU Scheduling: Preemptive and non-preemptive task management with live Gantt chart generation. (FCFS, SJF, SRTF, Round Robin)
Memory Management: Dynamic bandwidth allocation and fragmentation resolution. (MVT/MFT, First/Best/Worst Fit, Compaction)
Virtual Memory: Page replacement simulation for limited dispatcher monitors. (FIFO, LRU, Optimal, Second Chance/Clock, LFU, MFU)
Disk Scheduling (Virtual Memory): Optimal physical routing paths for response units, calculating total track count. (SSTF)
Mass Storage Management: Permanent archiving of resolved case files into physical disk blocks. (Contiguous, Linked, Indexed Allocation)
🛠️ Prerequisites
To run this application, you will need the following installed on your machine:

Python 3.8+
Tkinter (Usually comes pre-installed with Python. Linux users may need to run sudo apt-get install python3-tk)
Matplotlib (For rendering the dynamic Gantt charts and memory/routing graphs)
🚀 Installation & Setup
Follow these steps to get the simulator running on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/911-OS-Dispatch.git](https://github.com/yourusername/911-OS-Dispatch.git)
cd 911-OS-Dispatch
